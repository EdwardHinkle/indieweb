				<p>Ever feel frustrated by the limitations of your favourite social media site to post, share and consume the content in a way more customised and personalised to <strong>YOU</strong>?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column small-12 medium-6">
				<p>Or what about those occasions when a friend or family member isn’t on the same social media website as you? It can be a real pain sharing something with them unless they’ve got an account also. They may not be able to or want to sign-up for their own account.</p>

				<p>The IndieWeb community is made up of members who in many cases share these frustrations. By themselves or with the help of existing community members they’ve setup their own websites.</p>

				<p>The IndieWeb movement isn’t against using social networks. It draws inspiration from innovations that some of the most popular social media websites out there bring to the web.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column small-12">
				<p>The IndieWeb community collectively helps develop bridging technologies so that you can post content from your own website that can be simultaneously get syndicated out to some or all of your favourite social media services. The result: you don’t need to worry anyone’s missing out on what you post regardless of which social media website they use!</p>

		<h2>Isn’t getting your website a lot of work/expense?</h2>
		<div class="row">

				<p class="spacer">Starting your own website can seem like a lot of expense and work keeping it updated, organising a suitable place to host it and finding a content management system that’s secure but easy to setup and use.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column medium-6 small-12">
				<p>Whilst this can put many off ever setting up their own website, the end result is that you get to do a whole lot more with your content in the long term. When social media websites shutdown or get acquired by other companies your precious personal content such as blog posts, photos and messages can be lost all too easily.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column column-center small-12">
				<p><em><strong>The question to ask yourself is...</strong></em><br>Will setting up my own website be worth the effort in return for greater control over the content I publish and share and on the web?</p>

				<p>If there’s something you struggle with or feel is preventing you from taking the next steps in having your own website and having the means to public and share  your own content then there are community members here to help. Your insight or recommendations can also be very valuable to the community as a whole.</p>
